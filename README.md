# ulauncher-xfce-ss
Ulauncher-extension
Xfce4 ScreenShoting is now easy.  
Currently supported options:
- ss an area
- ss whole screen
- ss a focused window: ss window [int delay]

Just a tip, if you write it on your own and put it in the extension folder, it simply not gonna work. Somehow it has to be downloaded from github via ulauncher.
